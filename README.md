# gage-data-download
This repository is to document ways to download gage data. The initial notebook published uses NOAA-OWP github's hydrotools package (https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/tree/main) to download both NWS and USGS stream gage data. The NOAA github admin had some helpful advice in this discussion: https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/issues/256.
