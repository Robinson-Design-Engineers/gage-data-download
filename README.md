# gage-data-download
This repository is to document ways to download gage data. The initial notebook published uses NOAA-OWP github's hydrotools package (https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/tree/main) to download both NWS and USGS stream gage data. The NOAA github admin had some helpful advice in this discussion: https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrotools/issues/256. Some code developed by USGS's github is also included - there is some overlap between USGS and NOAA-OWP github functionalities. 

This is not considered an exhaustive notebook and more data retrieval methods are welcomed.
